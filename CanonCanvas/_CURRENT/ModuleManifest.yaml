version: "0.3.6"
mission: "Canvas-as-canon framework for dynamic project memory, standardized header patterns, LastCall ritual discipline, official younger-self note headering, and fork-survivable continuity."
must_preserve:
  - "durable long-term project memory"
  - "record it in canon canvas"
  - "canvas-first memory discipline"
  - "headers appear only when needed"
  - "do not pre-populate empty sections"
  - "standard header library (WIP)"
  - "LastCall is treated as a ritual command and never rendered as a canvas header title."
  - "Never render `🍺LastCall` or variants such as `🍺 Last Call snapshot` as section headers."
  - "`## 👴🏼 Fork Handoff Notes` is used (when needed) as the final section and is continuously consumed/pruned rather than allowed to accumulate."
  - "remove consumed items and clear the section when empty."
  - '`🍺LastCall` should end with a short, creative "note to younger self" tail line by default.'
  - "official younger-self note header"
  - "### 🚸 assistant's 👴🏼 note to → 📝 → younger 👶🏻 self"
  - "Do not assume a client exists."
  - "If client wording is short and available, capture it verbatim."
  - "lastcall is a safety net"
  - "canvases are durable across chat forks"
