# LogKit MachineManual

ModuleID: LogKit
Version: 0.4.6
DocRole: MachineManual
Audience: Assistant runtime operator

## Runtime Intent
Operate LogKit safely with fail-closed writes, explicit commit control, and configurable triage/export/retrieval behavior.

## Non-negotiables
- Treat `UserGuide.md` as canon.
- Write only to one active target ledger named `🖨️ <Name>` (default `🖨️ Log`, capital `L`) with valid META header.
- Target ledger must be a JSON code canvas.
- Look-before-leap: bind/open existing canonical ledger before creating any new ledger.
- Treat user-opened canvas as primary selection signal; never invent hidden UI controls.
- `🖨️` authorizes logging intent; it does not flush.
- Commit pending only on `logkit commit all` / `🖨️Flush`.
- If required artifacts are missing, fail closed and queue pending.
- If a command has an emoji alias, accept emoji-only invocations per UserGuide mapping.
- Every entry includes `time` in `HH:MM:SS` (24-hour) for deterministic ID repair.
- Entry `title` is a newspaper-style headline; if it needs horizontal scroll, rewrite shorter.

## Command Execution Contract

| Canon | Aliases | Inputs | Runtime action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `logkit load` | `🖨️ on` | `lane?: string` | Set lifecycle `loaded`; init state/config |
| `logkit activate` | `🖨️ activate` | none | Set lifecycle `active` |
| `logkit sleep` | `🖨️ sleep` | none | Set lifecycle `sleep` |
| `logkit unload` | `🖨️ off` | none | Clear volatile state, keep committed data |
| `logkit status` | `🖨️ status` | none | Emit lifecycle/queue/ledger status |
| `logkit capture` | `🖨️Log:` | `text: string` | Append candidate to pending |
| `logkit commit all` | `🖨️Flush`, `🖨️LogIt!` | none | Validate ledger, commit pending, clear queue |
| `logkit commit ids` | `🖨️001,003` | `ids: csv<int>` | Commit selected chip candidates |
| `logkit amend` | `🖨️Amend <id>:` | `id`, `delta` | Append linked amendment entry |
| `logkit overwrite` | `🖨️Overwrite <id>:` | `id`, `replacement` | Replace entry, increment revision |
| `logkit export` | `🛅 export` | `filter` | Produce JSONL + provenance |
| `logkit retrieve` | `🗄️ find` | `query`, `filter?` | Query attached/indexed logs |
| `logkit config set` | `🖨️ config` | `key`, `value` | Update config key |

## State Keys
- `logkit.lifecycle`
- `logkit.lane`
- `logkit.pending`
- `logkit.last_chip_set`
- `logkit.config`
- `logkit.ledger_health`

## Ledger Validation Routine
Before any write:
1. Discover candidate ledgers whose names start with `🖨️ `.
2. If `🖨️ Log` exists, bind/open it for default flow and do not create another default ledger.
3. Allow new ledger creation only when no suitable existing ledger exists or user explicitly requests an additional ledger.
4. Fail closed if more than one canvas is named `🖨️ Log` (duplicate default).
5. Verify exactly one target ledger is selected for the write turn.
6. Verify active canvas equals selected target ledger.
7. If active-canvas telemetry is unavailable, ask for explicit target confirmation (`use 🖨️ <Name>`) and bind that exact title.
8. Never create a new ledger to bypass missing active-canvas telemetry.
9. Verify selected target ledger name is either default `🖨️ Log` (capital `L`) or `🖨️ <PurposeName>`.
10. Verify target ledger is a JSON code canvas.
11. Verify line 1 META header:
```json
{"_":"META","tool":"LogKit","format":"PrettyJSONWithSentries","schema":"logkit.entry.v1"}
```
12. If any check fails, set `logkit.ledger_health` and queue pending.

## Triage Routine
- Honor `logkit.config.triage_mode` (`strict|balanced|capture_all`).
- AutoLog only for high-confidence durable records.
- Use PrintGate chips for uncertain candidates.
- Keep chip numbering monotonic for the chat session.

## Entry Schema Routine
Before commit, enforce minimum entry fields:
- `id`, `date`, `time`, `lane`, `source`, `title`, `description`, `status`, `kind`
- `time` must match `HH:MM:SS` (24-hour local capture time)
- `title` must be short headline style (not long sentence blocks)

## ID Generation Routine
Deterministic suffix formula (seconds-in-day / 2 rule):
1. Parse `time` as `HH:MM:SS`.
2. Compute `seconds_in_day = HH*3600 + MM*60 + SS`.
3. Compute `tick = floor(seconds_in_day / 2)`.
4. Compute `aaa = BASE36_UPPER(tick).padStart(3, "0")`.
5. Assemble ID as `LE-YYMMDD-aaa` using `date` for `YYMMDD`.
6. On collision, increment `tick` until unique.
7. If existing `id` and `time` disagree, recompute from `time` and correct `id`.

## Emoji Resolution Routine
When a user message includes only emoji tokens:
1. Resolve via declared alias map in `UserGuide.md`.
2. If a unique mapping exists, execute it.
3. If multiple mappings are possible, ask a one-line disambiguation question.
4. Never drop a declared emoji alias from interpretation.

## Lifecycle Controls
- `load`: initialize config + lane defaults.
- `activate`: allow capture/commit behavior.
- `sleep`: pause proactive triage, keep state.
- `unload`: clear volatile state and deactivate behavior.
- `status`: report lifecycle, queue depth, and artifact readiness.

## Output Envelope
- Default: `main_plus_microtail`.
- Microtail format: `LK[life=<state> queue=<n> ledger=<health> lane=<lane>]`.
- Structured outputs for `status`, `export`, and `retrieve`.

## Export and Retrieval Rules
- Export format is JSONL entry-per-line with provenance record.
- Retrieval may only search attached/indexed artifacts.
- Never fabricate results from inaccessible contexts.

## Security Rules
- Respect `logkit.config.privacy` policy.
- Block export when policy forbids data class transfer.
- Apply redaction behavior before export when configured.
- Track provenance for export/retrieval actions.

## Failure Behavior
- Missing ledger/canvas/meta: fail closed and provide exact remediation.
- Ambiguous target when multiple ledgers exist: fail closed and request explicit target (`🖨️ <PurposeName>`).
- Missing active-canvas telemetry without explicit title confirmation: fail closed and request `use 🖨️ <Name>`.
- Wrong canvas type for selected target: fail closed and require a JSON code canvas target.
- Duplicate default ledger (`🖨️ Log`) candidates: fail closed and request explicit winner.
- Unavailable service/index: return failure and request artifact attachment.
- Ambiguous or malformed emoji-only names (for example lone `️`): fail closed and require explicit `🖨️ <Name>` confirmation.
- Never rename the ledger canvas to a legacy ASCII fallback name.
