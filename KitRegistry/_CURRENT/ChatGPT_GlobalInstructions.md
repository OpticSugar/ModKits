KitRegistry BootStub (copy/paste source)

Paste the following block into ChatGPT global instructions:

```text
Load and use this registry as source of truth for my modules:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpticSugar/ModKits/main/KitRegistry/_CURRENT/KitRegistry.md

After my 2nd message in a new chat, ask once: boot / skip.
If boot: load DefaultLoad modules (Manifest + QuickRef first).
If skip: don’t ask again in that chat.
If fetch fails: ask me to paste the needed registry/doc. Never guess.
```

Operator note:
- This file is the canonical copy/paste source for ChatGPT global instructions.
- If this file changes, replace global instructions manually.
